Where are creative competencies standing in the midst of an unstoppable digitalization? Way behind. Within education, creative competencies see an urge to find a way to catch up; and up until now, there has been no fully digitalised method to learn them. Creative Twines is an ongoing, autonomous and innovative learning method that aims to create a virtual space to develop and learn new creative perspectives around serious questions or topics, and invites different minds to engage in narrative exercises shaped by the power of storytelling and playful interactions with creative coding.

The method, implemented in an interactive web platform, allows the human being to individually choose the narrative exercises they might be more interested in. Altogether with the goal of pushing creative learning one step closer to the foreground of digitization, and sparking educational engagement.
